bigPicture: ['Managing a fleet of vehicles requires expertise that many businesses don’t have. Enterprise Fleet Management, an affiliate of Enterprise, provides fleet management services for over 1.5 million fleet cars, trucks and vans in the USA and Canada.  It now offers an app that helps their clients better manage their fleets, improve productivity, drive down costs, and stay up-to-date on vehicle maintenance and technology for managing commercial vehicles.','Fleet managers are very dispersed across the U.S. and Canada working out of 55 regional locations and a national network of over 65,000 commercial fleet centers. The app provides all sorts of information enabling fleet managers to consistently get their jobs done right at any time or place']
whyAppstem: ['When Enterprise Fleet Management’s VP of IT created their RPF for the app he knew they needed a mobile partner with robust experience in design and development and back-end database integration. Appstem won the job over 6 other companies due to the team’s deep experience in mobile apps and the strong design team’s ability to deliver a clean, easy-to-use UI. Additionally, Appstem was able to provide an ongoing long-term process for updating and improving the app as needed, for years to come.']
challenges: ['It was important to make sure all information was accessible as possible at any given time for managers who might not be accustomed to using an app on the job. This required a slick and easy-to-use interface capable of delivering a wide range of information, from tracking mileage, finding local gas stations, oil change locations, service records, to completing an accident report along with pictures of the accident and damage reports. Enterprise was able to make their fleet managers more accountable and productive through the app. Details? NEED additional info if you have it.']
