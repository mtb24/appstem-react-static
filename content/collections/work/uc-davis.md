featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals, hubbub encourages better fitness by rewarding employees for consistently participating in a variety of healthy activities.
companyBlurb: ['UC Davis','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['A game-changing new telemedicine Web platform was created to help English-speaking doctors to quickly and accurately diagnose non-English speaking patients using an innovative combination of live video interviews and real-time translations delivered by subtitles.','The University of California, Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences has developed a first-of-a-kind telemedicine web platform in partnership with Appstem.','UC Davis is a pioneer in the use of telemedicine, which is reshaping how patients interact with healthcare providers, improving health outcomes and helping to drive down costs and wait times. The technology works by translating and transcribing non-English speaking patient interview videos, requiring strict adherence to privacy, HIPPA and other security regulations.','The project, which includes collaboration with UC San Francisco`s (UCSF) Clinical Informatics program, is funded by a grant from the federal Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality. It is led by Peter Yellowlees MD, professor of psychiatry at UC Davis and president-elect of the American Telemedicine Association, who has been researching telemedicine for more than 20 years.']
whyAppstem: ['Appstem was selected based on the team’s expertise in the healthcare industry, working with such companies as Kaiser Permanente, Cerner, Genentech, and Cambia Health, and their proven ability to work with HIPPA Compliance. Additionally, Appstem was evaluated on its ability to deliver a one-of-a-kind project that required significant creative and out-of-the-box thinking.']
challenges: ['It’s important to understand how the technology works to solve a unique communication problem: A Spanish patient has a psychiatric appointment with an English-speaking doctor. They cannot communicate directly with each other without help. In the past, a live translator would work to translate what the patient was saying and provide a transcript to the doctor well after the visit, resulting in a delay and reduced productivity for the doctor. This process also did not account for patient privacy and created some awkwardness and misunderstood communications.','Drs might ask “are you having a hallucination?” and get a very hard to decipher reply. Working with Appstem, a brand new approach was taken to provide real-time translation service that could be displayed as subtitles alongside the patient video during the interview.','Appstem researched a translator service with the capacity to be HIPPA compliant and found they could use Microsoft Azure. Putting it all together required a flawless UI/UX and significant expertise in integrating backend data. Appstem helped UC Davis facilitate live research experiments on the platform. The platform also had to be fine-tuned to provide highly accurate translation services.']
developmentText: ['What initially started as a proof-of-concept, research project has become a paradigm shift in telemedicine. It represents a big leap forward for the industry due to significant cost savings and a highly scalable solution that could potentially be used in any combination of languages and all different types of medical needs. As an added bonus, psychiatrists can also use the platform to securely record and share patient video interviews with other physicians and healthcare providers.']
