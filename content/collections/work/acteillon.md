featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals, hubbub encourages better fitness by rewarding employees for consistently participating in a variety of healthy activities.
companyBlurb: ['Actelion','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Compliance is a serious and central issue for biopharmaceutical companies. HIPAA and other violations are expensive, with noncompliance penalties ranging from $100 to $50,000, with a maximum penalty of $1.5 million per year.','Actelion, a global biopharmaceutical recently acquired by Johnson and Johnson, maintains a strict Compliance Program. It’s policy rules and regulations are detailed in a 100 page manual. In order to increase employee awareness and make compliance information easier to access, they decided to create an iOS app, which would initially be deployed for US employees.']
whyAppstem: ['The project required a high degree of expertise on many levels, from strategy, ideation, game play, UI/UX design, development and backend CMS system integration. Appstem won a competitive RFP process due to a higher level of experience across the board.']
challenges: ['The real challenge was not making a vast amount of information accessible, but to make employees want to be compliant. Compliance might be boring, but the app would be fun. Appstem took a grassroots approach by learning the intricacies of different policy requirements and understanding how employees would actually use the app in the field. To make learning about compliance interesting, the app was mostly designed around a gamified experience.','Depending on the use-case, the team explored different gaming options: Role-playing in a game helps employees simulate everyday situations. Quizzes are an addictive way to help employees test their knowledge and can keep track of scores - and employees love to test their knowledge. An anonymous hotline enables employees to ask questions and report incidents. All risk free for everyone to play around with: What happens in the app stays in the app.','Data is keyword searchable so that it’s easy to find common use-cases on-the-fly, such as, “how much can be spent taking a Dr to lunch?”. Information is very accessible on iPads and iPhones for sales and marketing personnel.','Additional challenges were met in juggling multiple global communication channels and technical implementations between Actelion’s global IT department, the compliance group and management team. This was streamlined by creating an overarching strategy and roadmap - from start to finish.']
devFeatures: ['Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Allschwil/Basel, Switzerland, that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments to serve high unmet medical needs.
