companyBlurb: ['DUFL','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Hubbub solves a classic mobile and web app problem: How do you create new habits?
Hubbub is a technology-driven wellness solution that taps into behavioral science, the strength of social circles, and a human drive towards incentives and game-playing to inspire employees towards healthier living. The Hubbub app can be customized by employers to create unique health-improvement experiences for their employees. By being actively engaged with how their employees relate to the app through data collection, engagement incentives, and social challenges, employers are able to take full ownership of their own successful health care programs.','Hubbub’s core business is helping people make healthy habits. Naturally, they looked at what would make healthy living more fun, but also what would make choosing “healthy” easier than “unhealthy”. Rather than forcing users to rely on willpower, Appstem worked with Hubbub to create virtual app-based environments and social groups that would reinforce new healthy habits.']
whyAppstem: ['Hubbub’s first turned to Appstem for a redesign of their website, which was seeing poor adoption and user-engagement. Appstem turned the redesign into a complete overhaul that would ensure they could build a truly habit-forming app. Appstem was selected after a competitive bid based on the strength of the team’s experience in healthcare, deep data integration, and experience in designing addictive, gamified apps.']
challenges: ['Hubbub’s app needed to reach diverse audiences across the country with all different health and fitness needs. Appstem knew it was important to capture interest as soon as people opened the app. They helped create an addictive on-boarding quiz about the current state of each individual’s health and health improvement goals. Users can select if they want to lose weight, eat more healthfully, get better sleep or regular exercise, and more.','The app then provides a series of appropriate “challenges” for employees based on their quiz answers. Going forward, daily app “challenges” keep users checking in at least once a day or more. Employees can also offer each other challenges like “do 50 push-ups” or “run a 10K”. The app needed to be capable of the heavy-lifting required for data integration with all kinds of leading wearables including Fitbit, Garmin Connect, Jawbone UP, Moves App and Nokia.','It would handle a massive amount of data such as activity, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, sleep analysis, run and cycling distances, and data related to third-party health platforms such as Apple Healthcare, and HIPPA compliance.']
