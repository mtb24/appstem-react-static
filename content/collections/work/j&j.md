companyBlurb: ['Johnson & Johnson','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Getting a group of friends together can be tough, but it’s especially hard when everyone in the group needs to sync up somewhere off-the-beaten-track, up in the mountains, or at a beach or lake. Ridey - one of the newest apps created by Apptem, was specifically designed to help people organize spontaneous surfing, mountain biking and paddle boarding trips with friends.','The app uses geo-mapping to help everyone in the group stay synced up on drive-times and expected party arrivals. Apptem is also handling the app launch, including App Store Optimization and marketing.']
whyAppstem: ['Messaging apps require heavy technical lifting, especially for functionality like turning messages off for individual users. It was a difficult technical challenge for even a highly experienced team. Appstem was chosen due to the team’s ability to provide these very specific technical messaging skills. The app was built on Firebase, Google’s mobile platform for developing high quality apps, a core expertise for the Appstem team.','Additionally, Appstem offered a critical component for any networking app needing to go viral: Launch services, including App Store Optimization (ASO), and market awareness to drive an early user-base. This turnkey approach was a very compelling factor in choosing Appstem’s team.']
challenges: ['Kicking off the project, Appstem visited Tesla’s flagship showroom on Santana Row, San Jose to understand the salespeople’s perspective and to take a closer look under the hood. Appstem set out to replace the previous web browser-based experience requiring sales and customers to scroll through different Web pages to find information.','Taking a sky’s-the-limit approach, the team considered, “what’s possible?” and “what’s necessary?” One swipe of the iPad would elegantly move videos and photos onto the 85 inch big screen TV; no small feat without Airplay. Devices had to be easily shared amongst staff throughout the day.','The team prioritized systems for fixing any bugs or crashes in all time zones, and a process for adding new features the moment they were announced. To make it all work, Appstem acted like an integrated part of the marketing team.']
devFeatures: [['j&j_choose_search.png','high-tech retail experience','Consistent with Tesla’s high-tech brand the Tesla Retail App takes the showroom into the 21st century.'],['j&j_search_results.png','Schedule a test drive','Connected iPads make scheduling a test drive a breeze, Tesla personnel swipe a prospective customer’s driver’s license to easily capture driver information']]
developmentText: ['Appstem created a first-of-it’s-kind app that streamlined the showroom experience in a way that’s true to the Tesla brand. Car-buyers, salespeople, marketing personnel and even members of the media --all use the app to find Telsa information in an equally intuitive and joyful way.','“Telsa quote with name and title” - Can we have them talk about why Appstem is a great long term partner they can rely on? Let me know if you want me to write.']
