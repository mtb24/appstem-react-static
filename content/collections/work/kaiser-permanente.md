featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals, hubbub encourages better fitness by rewarding employees for consistently participating in a variety of healthy activities.
companyBlurb: ['Kaiser Permanente','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['When Kaiser Permanente decided to build their first mobile app they envisioned a better way for members to interact with their doctors. They were looking to a future that required a key piece of technology: Video. Appstem’s expertise helped them create a first--of-a-kind the app that offered a unique video conferencing tool enabling members to directly connect with their doctors in real-time.','The app needed to strongly reflect the Kaiser brand and would ultimately be owned in-house by their own technical team. Appstem was tasked not only with building the app, but also helping to train Kaiser’s team of engineers to take on future implementations.']
whyAppstem: ['Appstems’ extensive experience with video technology was critical in creating a flawless implementation of the video conferencing feature. The team delivered the capacity, technical expertise, and mentorship needed to work with Kaisers back-end engineers to create a long-term working relationship.']
challenges: ['Appstem set out to understand what Kaiser members most needed from an app by looking at all the areas members depended on support and then evaluating how to create these features in an intuitive mobile UI. While working with cross-functional groups at Kaiser, Appstem was able to create a process for evaluating and prioritizing features. The team built prototypes and proof of concepts of the app that were then reviewed and approved - a lengthy but effective process.','It was important to accurately determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Kaiser engineering team in order to help them build the app to the next level, add new features, and maintain it. Appstem’s approach was essentially a working “bootcamp” for engineers, where Appstem worked hands-on with Kaiser’s team to flush out features and implement them into the final project']
developmentText: ['Over several years and iterations, the app has evolved to become a robust high-feature app that continuously goes beyond expectations based on reviews. Features of the app now include: Video-facilitated visits, appointment reminders, cancelling and rescheduling; preventative health reminders, prescriptions refills; access to lab test results, doctor’s email contact information and patient messaging, personalized pregnancy care, 24/7 appointment and advice, Dr recommendations from patients, and quick tips on health topics']
