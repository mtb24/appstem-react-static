featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals.
companyBlurb: ['Jetsuite X','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['JetSuiteX is a new player in commercial air travel offering an alternative to commercial airlines at an affordable price. Their brand promise is to deliver an airline experience without the hassle of commercial airlines. They needed a new website that would convey the brand’s modern luxury, yet deliver flight bookings quickly and intuitively.']
whyAppstem: ['JetSuiteX turned to Appstem because they needed a highly experienced hard core development partner that could quickly bring together the work of all the other partners on a tight deadline. Appstem managed the website project across two other companies providing the flight booking widget and their API integration.','The company had just hired a new marketing agency and was also working with a new design partner. Additionally, Appstem coordinated the project with their website design partner and new marketing agency and internal IT - to deliver the whole project within a three month deadline.']
challenges: ['Great things are the sum of the parts. For the JetSuiteX site, many parts had to be flawlessly integrated to increase booking on a gorgeously branded new site. This required collaborating with global teams across development, IT, and marketing to deliver a world-class site in less than three months.','UI/UX, design, photography and a complex backend CMS system were all integrated to enable a booking experience that delivered on speed, exhilaration and convenience. A customized CMS interface for JetSuite’s marketing team enables them to manage all the website content with the ability to remove, edit, and add media in real-time as needed.']
developmentText: ['Within the first month, JetSuite doubled its regular $50K/day bookings. Visitors booking flights experience JetSuite’s promise of “waitlessness”.']
