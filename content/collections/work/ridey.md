featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals, hubbub encourages better fitness by rewarding employees for consistently participating in a variety of healthy activities.
companyBlurb: ['Ridey','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Getting a group of friends together can be tough, but it’s especially hard when everyone in the group needs to sync up somewhere off-the-beaten-track, up in the mountains, or at a beach or lake. Ridey - one of the newest apps created by Apptem, was specifically designed to help people organize spontaneous surfing, mountain biking and paddle boarding trips with friends.','The app uses geo-mapping to help everyone in the group stay synced up on drive-times and expected party arrivals. Apptem is also handling the app launch, including App Store Optimization and marketing.']
whyAppstem: ['Hubbub’s first turned to Appstem for a redesign of their website, which was seeing poor adoption and user-engagement. Appstem turned the redesign into a complete overhaul that would ensure they could build a truly habit-forming app. Appstem was selected after a competitive bid based on the strength of the team’s experience in healthcare, deep data integration, and experience in designing addictive, gamified apps.']
challenges: ['Group messaging is often painful, bringing a continuous barrage of texts and beeping. Once you’re on a group text, you’re going to get every ping from everyone, regardless of whether you can make an event, need details, or need to focus on other things.','Ridey set out to alleviate the bombardment of continuous mobile text notifications typical of group gatherings. Apptem helped them focus on delivering a highly responsive messaging tool capable of being turned off as needed.']
developmentText: ['Appstem delivered a highly responsive app with a unique messaging experience that’s an order of magnitude better than texting a group of friends. (NOTE: we should add results of ASO/FB outreach).']
