featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals.
companyBlurb: ['Vowla','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['After years of creating amazing weddings for high-end clients, VowLA had perfected the ultimate “wedding planner blueprint”. Then, the company’s CEO, Jenny Chang, had a game-changing idea to scale the business by creating a marketplace where people could plan their own high end weddings using VowLA’s trusted vendor network.The idea for the app was born.','Many wedding planning apps are available, but only VowLA offers a unique “marketplace” approach to “matching” people with the right wedding planners and vendors based on individual tastes and budgets. The app works by giving users access to curated database of wedding vendors that have a known style and budget as they have been contributing to VowLA’s trusted vendor community for years. This difference needed to ring loud and clear in a crowded app marketplace and reach the right audience. VowLA’s users typically spend well above the industry average, which was $35,329 in 2016. The “joy” of planning one’s own wedding was also a big factor. The app would need to be made for planner heaven.']
whyAppstem: ['VowLA is a complex, first-of-its-kind app that has the capacity to match users with vendors based on timing and need. Building it required thinking outside of the box. Appstem was chosen for its entrepreneurial approach and willingness to take risks. It was possible to mitigate these risks by starting with a deep understanding of the business and performance metrics. To do this, Appstem began with what success looks based on metrics for VowLA’s existing business.  Appstem worked closely with the team at VowLA to break-down each step of the planning process with a cohesive flow. Every feature of the app was required to fit into this flow framework to ensure productive and seemingly intuitive planning for users. The entire team, from designers, engineers, product managers to VowLA’s CEO, made decisions based on the end goal - a journey that tied in every last planning detail in the right place.','Strong branding was essential given VowLA’s existing business and the crowded wedding app market. Appstem was able to draw on its experience representing many well-known brands such as Tesla and Enterprise.']
challenges: ['In order to ensure the app stood out for its most valuable differences, Appstem took a look at how VowLA’s existing clientele approached specific problems, such as creating an accurate wedding budget, working back from the big day on a timeline, and the hardest part to get right - choosing the right style and vendors.','The app is unique in that it serves as a tastemaker - enabling planners to explore their own style preferences in a more productive way with real vendors that reflect their existing personal styles. In order to make this real, Apptem worked very carefully in creating onboarding style surveys.','Designing a clean, intuitive UI and user experience was critical for the wedding timeline to flow enabling users to build on the work they were doing in the app over a relatively long period of time. It was equally important to design the marketplace in a way that met performance expectations ensuring that vendors would be able to maximize their work hours through the app, while meeting timing requirements for individual planners.']
