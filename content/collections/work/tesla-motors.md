featureBlockProjectDesc: A health and wellness solution serving both companies and individuals.
companyBlurb: ['Tesla','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Tesla is changing everything about buying cars including the showroom experience. People are invited into Tesla showrooms to explore Tesla’s technology, learn about owning an electric car and ultimately, to configure their dream car -  which will be built and delivered in the future. The experience requires detailed research, product information and feature-rich images -- all of which are delivered in real-time by the Tesla IOS iPad app.','Tesla’s data-rich experience is kept consistent across all of its 120 locations in 24 countries worldwide through the centralized app. Visitors get started by simply swiping their driver’s license on the app, which adds their driver details and approves them for a test drive. Sales personnel are able to seamlessly reserve test drives, receive digital signatures and instantly update sales data into Salesforce – all within their local regions. The app is localized for each respective location.']
whyAppstem: ['Naturally, the company building the world’s fastest production car needed a team capable of delivering results faster. The project also required a long term commitment to ensure ongoing consistency as new global locations were added.','Drawing on the experience of previous projects with AppStem, Tesla was assured of the long-term staying power of key members of the team and it’s ability to continuously meet extreme deadlines.']
challenges: ['Kicking off the project, Appstem visited Tesla’s flagship showroom on Santana Row, San Jose to understand the salespeople’s perspective and to take a closer look under the hood. Appstem set out to replace the previous web browser-based experience requiring sales and customers to scroll through different Web pages to find information.','Taking a sky’s-the-limit approach, the team considered, “what’s possible?” and “what’s necessary?” One swipe of the iPad would elegantly move videos and photos onto the 85 inch big screen TV; no small feat without Airplay. Devices had to be easily shared amongst staff throughout the day.','The team prioritized systems for fixing any bugs or crashes in all time zones, and a process for adding new features the moment they were announced. To make it all work, Appstem acted like an integrated part of the marketing team.']
devFeatures: [['Tesla-iPad-HomePage.png','high-tech retail experience','Consistent with Tesla’s high-tech brand the Tesla Retail App takes the showroom into the 21st century.'],['iPads_&_iPhone_Examples.png','Schedule a test drive','Connected iPads make scheduling a test drive a breeze, Tesla personnel swipe a prospective customer’s driver’s license to easily capture driver information']]
developmentText: ['Appstem created a first-of-it’s-kind app that streamlined the showroom experience in a way that’s true to the Tesla brand. Car-buyers, salespeople, marketing personnel and even members of the media --all use the app to find Telsa information in an equally intuitive and joyful way.','“Telsa quote with name and title” - Can we have them talk about why Appstem is a great long term partner they can rely on? Let me know if you want me to write.']
