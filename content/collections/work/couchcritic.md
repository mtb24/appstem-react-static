companyBlurb: ['CouchCritic','Hubbub, a Cambia Health company, developed a customizable corporate wellness program that seamlessly uses technology, activity trackers, targeted incentives and game mechanics to turn things we all need to be doing—like drinking more water or taking the stairs—into motivating challenges that help people achieve a healthier lifestyle. Their app aims to improve employee wellness while employers benefit from healthier and happier employees.']
bigPicture: ['Getting a group of friends together can be tough, but it’s especially hard when everyone in the group needs to sync up somewhere off-the-beaten-track, up in the mountains, or at a beach or lake. Ridey - one of the newest apps created by Apptem, was specifically designed to help people organize spontaneous surfing, mountain biking and paddle boarding trips with friends.','The app uses geo-mapping to help everyone in the group stay synced up on drive-times and expected party arrivals. Apptem is also handling the app launch, including App Store Optimization and marketing.']
whyAppstem: ['Messaging apps require heavy technical lifting, especially for functionality like turning messages off for individual users. It was a difficult technical challenge for even a highly experienced team. Appstem was chosen due to the team’s ability to provide these very specific technical messaging skills. The app was built on Firebase, Google’s mobile platform for developing high quality apps, a core expertise for the Appstem team.','Additionally, Appstem offered a critical component for any networking app needing to go viral: Launch services, including App Store Optimization (ASO), and market awareness to drive an early user-base. This turnkey approach was a very compelling factor in choosing Appstem’s team.']
challenges: ['Group messaging is often painful, bringing a continuous barrage of texts and beeping. Once you’re on a group text, you’re going to get every ping from everyone, regardless of whether you can make an event, need details, or need to focus on other things.','Ridey set out to alleviate the bombardment of continuous mobile text notifications typical of group gatherings. Apptem helped them focus on delivering a highly responsive messaging tool capable of being turned off as needed.']
